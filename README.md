# Web Development Trivia
The Goal of this project was to create an interactive and fun trivia game with a timer that tests the users knowlege on basic JavaScript information. 

As the user progresses they are shown the number of question they are on and a timer displays with how many seconds they have to answer the question. 

The final screen reveals the users score and gives them an option to replay the quiz or to quit.



## Sources

I used a youtube tutorial on a JS trivia game as the framework for the website - I followed the tutorial pretty closely but adjusted some css to fit the style I wanted for the site. And created my own unique set of 10 questions. this is the tutorial that was followed:

## Future Updates

I unfortunately ran out of time before being able to get the localStorage funtion to store high scores - that will be updated soon.

I plan to add more questions for more advanced Javascript topics and a function to randomize the questions asked. 

The CSS still needs a lot of work to be more presentable - I wanted yellow for the JS theme but will probably adjust that to be something easier on the eyes (possible a dark mode).
